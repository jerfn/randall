The first thing I did was read through randall.c to get a general understanding of the structure and what each part of the code did.
I added some comments to help with my understanding.

I then read through the Makefile and got a general understanding of it, then proceeded to add a check rule that performs a simple
check to see if the length of the output of randall matches what is expected.

To start refactoring, I created options.c and options.h to handle command line arguments, currently of which only reading nbytes exists.
I moved the code that reads nbytes to options.c and options.h and edited the Makefile to update the compilation and linking.
